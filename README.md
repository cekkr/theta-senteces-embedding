# theta-senteces-embedding

Experimenting with sentence embedding through theta vectors (0 to PI).

## 3
It's the magic number: infact 3 and its multipliers are the right equilibrium for classification using theta vectors.

Imagine a circle with just two colors for pole: it would be symmetrical, so using theta vectors would be useless. Instead, with three colors, we can describe the entire rainbow spectrum.

I propose to the utmost four basic vectors for sentence: who/what, how, when, why. But, essentially, a vector can have a detail level, that brought the double of last level vectors (so 1+2+4+8...). That means that a level of detail is not just a "more precise number", but the doubled dimension of perception.
